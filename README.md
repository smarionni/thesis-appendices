The greatest part about using LaTeX to write my thesis and using Jupyter for my data analysis was perhaps the ability to include my code notebooks as appendices in my thesis. For anyone getting a PhD at UW, I recommend Jim Foxâ€™s excellent template available [here](https://staff.washington.edu/fox/tex/uwthesis.shtml).

I'll continue to add the remaining appendices as well as some additional notebooks I used for my graduate research as soon as my remaining manuscripts are submitted for publication.
